# Controlled Profits Backend

Rails JSON API for controlled profits site

All responses are formatted as specified by JSONAPI.org v1.0, with the exception of the Content-Type Header, which is ignored at the time of writing.

http://jsonapi.org/format/

## Authentication

All authentication is done using JSON Web Tokens. After creating a user using the request method and routes listed below, you must request a token, which will be given in the header of /auth/sign_in response if the posted user's credentials are correct. This header will contain these important fields:

access-token → vrLn7nm6kNIbAaJ_AIlyQQ

client → xpjUiiBvu9Ssb4oelpOBjA

token-type → Bearer

uid → user_email@email.com

Following that sign in response, these fields must be provided in every subsequent request sent to the server in order to be authenticated. If you do not already have a solution to manage this part of the request cycle, I have read that JToker might be a good option.

## Routes:

### User Routes:

**NOTE: All of these paths are preceded by `/auth/`**

| path | method | purpose |
|:-----|:-------|:--------|
| /    | POST   | Email registration. Requires **`firstname`**, **`lastname`**, **`email`**, **`password`**, and **`password_confirmation`** params. Allows **`active_business_id`**|
| / | DELETE | Account deletion. This route will destroy users identified by their **`uid`**, **`access_token`** and **`client`** headers. |
| / | PUT/PATCH | Account updates. This route will update an existing user's account settings. Accepted params are **`firstname`**, **`lastname`**, **`active_business_id`**, **`password`** and **`password_confirmation`**. If **`config.check_current_password_before_update`** is set to `:attributes` the **`current_password`** param is checked before any update, if it is set to `:password` the **`current_password`** param is checked only if the request updates user password. |
| /sign_in | POST | Email authentication. Requires **`email`** and **`password`** as params. This route will return a JSON representation of the `User` model on successful login along with the `access-token` and `client` in the header of the response. |
| /sign_out | DELETE | Use this route to end the user's current session. This route will invalidate the user's authentication token. You must pass in **`uid`**, **`client`**, and **`access-token`** in the request headers. |
| /:provider | GET | Set this route as the destination for client authentication. Ideally this will happen in an external window or popup. [Read more](#omniauth-authentication). |
| /:provider/callback | GET/POST | Destination for the oauth2 provider's callback uri. `postMessage` events containing the authenticated user's data will be sent back to the main client window from this page. [Read more](#omniauth-authentication). |
| /validate_token | GET | Use this route to validate tokens on return visits to the client. Requires **`uid`**, **`client`**, and **`access-token`** as params. These values should correspond to the columns in your `User` table of the same names. |
| /password | POST | Use this route to send a password reset confirmation email to users that registered by email. Accepts **`email`** and **`redirect_url`** as params. The user matching the `email` param will be sent instructions on how to reset their password. `redirect_url` is the url to which the user will be redirected after visiting the link contained in the email. |
| /password | PUT | Use this route to change users' passwords. Requires **`password`** and **`password_confirmation`** as params. This route is only valid for users that registered by email (OAuth2 users will receive an error). It also checks **`current_password`** if **`config.check_current_password_before_update`** is not set `false` (disabled by default). |
| /password/edit | GET | Verify user by password reset token. This route is the destination URL for password reset confirmation. This route must contain **`reset_password_token`** and **`redirect_url`** params. These values will be set automatically by the confirmation email that is generated by the password reset request. |

### Business Routes:

**NOTE: All of these paths are preceded by `/v1/businesses/`**
**Also, all request headers must include the fields described in the `Authentication` section**

| path | method | purpose |
|:-----|:-------|:--------|
| / | GET    | Returns a JSON array listing all a current user's businesses|
| / | POST   | Creates a new business. Requires fields **`name`**, **`naics`**, **`sic`**, and **`ein`** |
| /:bid | GET | Returns a JSON object with all of a given businesses' stored details, where :bid is the business id |
| /:bid | PATCH/PUT | Updates a business by ID |
| /:bid | DELETE    | Deletes a business by ID |

### Business Data Entry Routes:

**NOTE: All of these paths are preceded by `/v1/businesses/:bid/data`**
**Also, all request headers must include the fields described in the `Authentication` section**

| path | method | purpose |
|:-----|:-------|:--------|
| / | GET    | Returns a JSON array listing the entire history of a given business' data entries |

#### Optional request parameters (Join as many as necessary in the URL with the & symbol)
| path | method | purpose |
|:-----|:-------|:--------|
| /?start_date=yyyy/mm/dd&end_date=yyyy/mm/dd) | GET | Returns all of a businesses data entries, within a specified date range |
| /?section=(income_statement/balance_sheet/sales_and_marketing/finanacial_roi) | GET | Returns only one section for each businesses data entry |
| /?entry_type=(actual/adjusted) | GET | Returns data entries by entry type: actual or adjusted |

#### JSON Response format:
```
{
  data: [
    {
      id: "1",
      type: "business_data_entry",
      entry_type: "actual",
      entry_date: "2017-09-30T19:34:55.000Z",
      business_id: "5",
      income_statement: {...},
      balance_sheet: {...},
      sales_and_marketing: {...},
      financial_roi: {...}
    }, 
    {
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

For example, a `GET` request to the url:

`http://localhost:3000/v1/businesses/1/data?section=income_statement&entry_type=actual&start_date=2017/09/03&end_date=2017/09/06`
